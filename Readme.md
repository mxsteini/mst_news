# EXT:mst_news - News extension

## Situation

This extension should not be an competition to EXT:news, but rather an example of how to create a complex feature with typoscript.

In most cases, the users want to have some news on their website but in page style.

They don't have many news and don't want to have a whole news system with all the features. They only want to have the ability to add news via the backend and display them on the page. But with the whole TYPO3 content element features.

## Features

- purely typoscript based
